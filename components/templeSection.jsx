    history: `
Kashi Vishwanath Temple has a rich history dating back to ancient times. It is mentioned in the Skanda Purana and is believed to have been originally built in the 11th century. The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times during invasions by Muslim rulers, most notably by Aurangzeb, who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque adjacent to it. The current structure was rebuilt in 1780 by Ahilyabai Holkar, the Queen of Indore. Over the centuries, it has become a symbol of unwavering faith, devotion, and resilience.`,
    
    importance: `
The temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, making it one of the most sacred shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. Devotees believe that a visit to Kashi Vishwanath and a dip in the Ganges can wash away all sins and grant liberation (moksha). The temple is considered the spiritual heart of Varanasi, also called Kashi, which is regarded as the oldest living city in the world. Thousands of devotees from India and abroad visit the temple every day to seek blessings and participate in sacred rituals.`,
    
    architecture: `
The temple features a prominent gold-plated spire and domes, which were donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century. Its sanctum houses the revered Shiva Linga made of black stone, set in a silver altar.

The narrow lanes leading to the temple are bustling with pilgrims and filled with spiritual energy.`,

The Mangala Aarti, which occurs early in the morning, is one of the most powerful and sacred experiences for pilgrims.`,
    
    mythology: `
According to legend, Lord Shiva declared Kashi as his eternal abode. It is believed that anyone who dies in Kashi will attain salvation, as Lord Shiva whispers the Taraka Mantra in their ears at the time of death. The temple and the city are said to be standing on the trident (Trishul) of Shiva, which makes them indestructible. These stories make Kashi Vishwanath not just a temple, but a timeless center of cosmic power.`

    description: {
  history: `
Baba Baidyanath Dham, located in Deoghar, Jharkhand, is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. It is said to have been established when Ravana, the king of Lanka, offered nine of his ten heads to Lord Shiva at this site.

The temple has been a site of intense spiritual activity for centuries and attracts millions of pilgrims every year.`,

  rituals: `
Priests conduct daily Abhishekam, and devotees offer milk, honey, and sacred leaves. The temple sees a large influx during Maha Shivaratri and Shravan. Prayers for health, protection, and overcoming obstacles are commonly offered here.`,
